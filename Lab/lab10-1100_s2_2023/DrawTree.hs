Module for drawing nice looking trees

Don't worry too much about how this works,
or the types of these functions.
It's beyond the scope of this course.

data BinaryTree a = Null | Node (BinaryTree a) a (BinaryTree a)
    deriving Show

printTree :: (Show a) => BinaryTree a -> IO ()
printTree = putStr.unlines.draw

draw :: (Show a) => BinaryTree a -> [String]
draw Null = ["Null"]
draw (Node left x right) = (show x) : drawSubTrees [right,left]
  where
    drawSubTrees [] = []
    drawSubTrees [t] =
        "|" : shift "`- " "   " (draw t)
    drawSubTrees (t:ts) =
        "|" : shift "+- " "|  " (draw t) ++ drawSubTrees ts

    shift first other = zipWith (++) (first : repeat other)
